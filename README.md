# Mobian website
This repository is a repository for my proposed changes to the https://mobian-project.org/ website.

## The proposal & Why we need this change
The Mobian website in its current state is inconsistent across pages and does not incorperate modern design language into its website. The new design takes inspiration from the existing [Mobian blog page](https://blog.mobian-project.org/) and incorperates newer design elements as well as elements from [the Debian website](https://debian.org) such as the banner. Moving to this design will help the intuitiveness, user-friendliness and readability of the website,

## Technologies
The website was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is generated using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/), however the Mobian project will still be using Hugo as the backend SSG for the website. The project lead for Mobian will use the source code from the website and make adjustments where necessary to get it running with Hugo.
